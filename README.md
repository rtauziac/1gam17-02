# 1GAM17-02

My second entry for the February 1 game a month challenge. The optional theme is **Anthem**.  
This game is made with [Superpowers](http://superpowers-html5.com/index.en.html).

You can [play it here](https://rtauziac.github.io/1gam17-02/index.html). It may take time to load all sounds.

Controls:

* X,C: Control the left hand
* B,N: Control the right hand

The game is all about playing organ. You can't precisely control your hands, thats on purpose.
